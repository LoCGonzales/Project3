# Project 3 - Remote Work & Mental Health

# Overview:
‚ÄúAs remote work becomes the new norm, it's essential to understand its impact on employees' mental well-being. This dataset dives into how working remotely affects stress levels, work-life balance, and mental health conditions across various industries and regions.
With 5,000 records collected from employees worldwide, this dataset provides valuable insights into key areas like work location (remote, hybrid, onsite), stress levels, access to mental health resources, and job satisfaction. It‚Äôs designed to help researchers, HR professionals, and businesses assess the growing influence of remote work on productivity and well-being. üåøüìà‚Äù<br>

### Impact of Work Location on Mental Health
Remote work shows slightly higher instances of anxiety and burnout, but also more individuals with no mental health conditions.
Onsite work has a lower prevalence of "None" in terms of mental health conditions, with higher rates of burnout.
### Industry Benefits from Remote Work
Consulting and IT industries benefit the most from remote work in terms of satisfaction, with the majority of employees in remote setups being satisfied compared to hybrid and onsite

### Satisfaction with Remote Work by Work Location
Satisfaction is slightly higher for onsite workers compared to hybrid and remote. <br>
Remote work has a lower satisfaction rate, with higher percentages in the Neutral and Unsatisfied categories.<br>
Hybrid work shows a fairly even distribution, with no dominant satisfaction level, which might suggest that hybrid work arrangements cater to a wide range of experiences.

### Average Hours Worked by Mental Health Condition
Overall, while all groups are close to a standard 40-hour workweek, there is a slight trend where increasing hours align with mental health challenges, with burnout showing the highest hours worked. <br>This points to the importance of monitoring workloads and ensuring resources are available to help manage mental health, especially as hours begin to exceed the standard 40-hour mark.

### Physical activity vs Sleep quality
 I analyzed the physical activity and sleep quality of 5,000 people. Based on this chart, there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a significant difference in sleep quality based on physical activity levels (weekly, none, daily), as most people fall under either the ‚ÄòGood‚Äô or ‚ÄòAverage‚Äô sleep quality categories across all levels of physical activity.

### Physical activity vs Mental health condition
The distribution of mental health conditions appears to be relatively consistent across all levels of physical activity. Whether individuals are physically active weekly, not at all, or daily, a large portion of the population reports no mental health issues. Conditions such as burnout, depression, and anxiety are present, but the level of physical activity doesn‚Äôt show a sharp distinction in mental health condition prevalence.This chart suggests that while physical activity may have some impact on mental health, it might not be the primary factor determining mental health conditions, as the trends are relatively similar across all groups.

###  Job_Role and Industry
By comparing the heights of the bars, one can identify which job roles are most common within each industry, as well as which industries have the most diverse job roles. the data highlights trends that reflect industry needs in both human resources and technical capabilities, with certain roles like Software Engineers and Data Scientists becoming essential across a variety of sectors.

### Years of Experience by age and gender General Trends:
As individuals age, total experience tends to increase, particularly for females in the younger age groups.
Males have consistently higher average experience at younger ages, but this trend appears to shift as they age, particularly in the 46-55 age group where females surpass them.
Experience Distribution:
The highest total experiences are found in the 26-35 age group, indicating a peak work experience level during these years.
In older age groups, experience levels drop, likely reflecting retirement trends and reduced workforce participation.
Gender Comparisons:
Females tend to have slightly lower total experiences in the youngest age group, but their averages rise significantly in the older age brackets.
Males generally have higher total experience in the early years but see a decline relative to females as age increases.
This summary highlights key patterns in work experience across different age groups and genders, offering insights into career progression and workforce dynamics.
### High Stress Level by Age Range
The analysis reveals that stress is particularly high among individuals aged 26-45, highlighting a critical period in life where work, family, and personal development intersect. <br>
Understanding these trends allows organizations and individuals to take targeted action to mitigate stress, especially for those in the peak of their careers, while recognizing that stress often decreases with age or retirement.

### Stress level associated with hours work and virtual meetings
This bubble chart shows the relationship between hours worked per week and virtual meetings, with stress levels represented by bubble size and color. Larger, darker bubbles indicate higher stress, while smaller, lighter bubbles show lower stress. Employees with longer hours and more meetings tend to experience higher stress, while lower stress is more spread among those with fewer work hours or meetings. The chart highlights how a heavier workload and frequent meetings are linked to increased stress.
### Synthesis of Stress Trends
The analyses show that the 26-45 age group experiences the highest stress, particularly those working long hours and attending frequent virtual meetings. This group faces dual pressures from peak career demands and heavy meeting schedules. To reduce stress, strategies should focus on minimizing meeting fatigue, offering flexible workloads, and supporting work-life balance.

### Conclusion 
In our study of 5,000 individuals across various work environments, we found that the consulting and IT sectors benefit most from remote work, though on-site employees report slightly higher job satisfaction. Increased working hours are a key factor in burnout, while physical activity has minimal effect on mental health. Notably, females tend to have competitive or higher experience levels compared to males in most age groups, particularly as age increases. Our findings offer organizations insights to improve employee well-being and productivity by adopting flexible, tailored strategies.
